# Stego Challenge: Uncover the Hidden Image!

Welcome to the Steganography Challenge! Are you ready to embark on an exciting journey into the world of secret messages and hidden images? This challenge is all about the mysterious art of **steganography**, where we cleverly hide one image inside another!

## What’s Steganography?
Steganography is like a magician’s trick—it’s all about concealing information in plain sight! Instead of simply encrypting a message or an image, steganography allows us to hide one image within another. Our goal in steganography is to create an image (called the stego image) that looks just like any other images, all while concealing the secret within. It’s a fascinating intersection of art and technology, and today you’ll see just how fun it can be!

## Getting Started
To get in on the fun, you’ll need a Python environment set up with a couple of helpful libraries: Pillow for image processing and NumPy for handling array operations. If you haven’t done so yet, don’t worry! Just pop open your terminal and install with:
```
pip install Pillow numpy
```
* Pillow: A Python Imaging Library that adds image processing capabilities.
* NumPy: A library for numerical computing in Python, useful for handling arrays.
* 
With your environment ready, you can start exploring the provided images and get ready to extract the hidden treasure!

## Your Mission
Now for the exciting part! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to analyze the `chall.py` code, figure out how to extract the hidden image and reverse the process! 

Imagine what could be hiding in that stego image! Maybe it’s a hidden message or a delightful illustration waiting to be revealed. The possibilities are endless!
